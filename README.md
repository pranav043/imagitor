# Imagitor

Imagitor, a photo editing solution, presents a wealth of editing options including brightness control, inversion, saturation adjustments, rotation and more. Built with NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS, HTML, and CSS, photo editing can be done from a web browser without the need for downloads.
Inclusion of a dark mode option reduces eye strain during late-night editing sessions.
